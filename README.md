# COMP2160 Prac Week 13b - Procedural Animation

## LETs and LEUs
A reminder to please take a moment to complete the LETs and LEUs for this unit. This feedback is really important, and we need to reach a certain number of participants for us to see any of it. Please, if you have the time, fill them out.

## Today's Task
Today you will be implementing a basic forom of procedural animation, creating a snake-like creature entirely in code. This is a somewhat advanced practical that is not reflected in the learning materials for this unit, but instead designed for those interested in the kinds of procedural animation you might find in games like Rain World. You can play a sample solution [here](https://uncanny-machines.itch.io/comp2160-week-13a-prac).

Note: This is one of two "bonus pracs" you can complete in Week 13. You can only recieve marks for one of them. If you have already completed 12 practials, you will not receive any marks for this prac.

## Step 1 - Basic bones (10 min)
We are going to start with a very basic set-up. In the project, you'll find a single object called "Creature", which has a script attached to it by the same name.

Inside the Creature script, you'll find relatively familiar code for getting the creature to move towards the mouse position. The creature is represented by drawing a sphere at its location using Gizmos. Feel free to spend a little bit of time making sure you are familiar with the code, but don't tweak any paramaters just yet.

## Step 2 - Adding parts (20 min)

## Step 3 - Creating a shape (30 min)

## Step 4 - Drawing the shape (40 min)

## Step 5 - More advanced forms (20 min)
